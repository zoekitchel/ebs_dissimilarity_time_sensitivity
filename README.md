# ebs_dissimilarity_time_sensitivity

How does our ability to accurately detect biotic homogenization and differentiation vary with time series length?

Here, we use the 36 year long Eastern Bering Sea fisheries independent trawl survey to determine how trends in community dissimilaity vary by the number of observations you have of an ecosystem. Data are publically available, and observations of fish are standardized and cleaned by the [FishGlob consortium](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/fishglob/). 

All data and code are available in this repository.
